          This is the separate window where you can participate in the calls.
          You can dial another person on the list from RemoteVU, which is
          intended for “connections”. Once you either call the designated person
          or accept a call from another person, you will be directed to this
          separate session window. In this window, you can see the patient from
          the big screen on the centre of the screen. The featured objective is
          a patient who needs the clinician's assistance, and it is the guardian
          who is taking care of the patients. You can also see who is
          participating in the session from the smaller screen sizes.

          The following are the changes we've made: we have coloured the menu as
          darker blue to give a clear contrast from the content we have kept the
          logo on the top to indicate its branding we have added a small mark to
          indicate the designated location of the user we have moved the setting
          button on the top-right, next to the designated location we have added
          the description of the page for each menu to explain what the user can
          do on each page we have distinguished each column to ensure smooth
          navigation we have added a QR code to make sure that the devices are
          well-seen and used

          The following are the changes we've made: we have applied the similar
          UI setting on the menu and on the top of the portal we have applied
          the similar UI setting in terms of the menu description we have
          changed the graph about the usage from the linear graph to a segmented
          graph depending on use we have differentiated the history (underneath
          the graph) by adding more detail such as the identification of caller,
          the identification of participants, the duration of time for each
          calls, status of recording, and indication where the saved files can
          be found

          The following are the changes we've made: we have changed how the
          navigation bar appears to be: the navigation icon bar for the Desktop
          PC or Mac will appear at the bottom of the screen (following the
          industry convention) and the navigation icon bar to control the
          smart-glasses will appear in the left side of the centred display box.
          Basically, if the mouse does not hover around the biggest screen in
          this video-session, the separated buttons for the smart glasses will
          not appear. we have grouped the icons together and distributed them to
          either the left, the centre, and the right depending on its purpose we
          have utilized the blank white space as much as we can by re-sizing the
          participant screens.

            TeleVU Innovations Inc. is a privately-owned telecommunication
            corporation that connects the clinicians and the patients on a
            remote-basis to reduce the wait times and to offer improved medical
            assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            TeleVU Innovations Inc. offers two different products that are
            connected to each other. One of them is the access to the desktop
            website that clinicians can use to treat patients remotely.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Desktop website, the customers can sign-up, cancel, call another
            customer who use the same program, initiate a video-call, record a
            video-call (while in session) or review the recorded videos in
            history.

            The other product is the service in glasses which is wearable. This
            machine is usually provided to the guardians or nurses who can
            assist the patients.<br />
            Similar to the Desktop website, the patient's guardian(s) or the
            nurse-in-charge can either dial or accept the call from clinicians
            who are calling them from the Desktop website.
